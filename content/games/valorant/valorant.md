I find it to be a pale copy of Counter-Strike, and most of the things they've added to make the game worse. The game does not feel good, does not sound good, and is quite frustrating to learn.

Perhaps after playing it for a bunch of hours, watch videos and guides on all the characters it'd be more enjoyable

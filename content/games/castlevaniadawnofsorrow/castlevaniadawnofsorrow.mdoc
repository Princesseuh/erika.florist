I liked this! I thought it did was it was aiming for really nicely, that is being a more kid friendly Castlevania to reach new audiences

However, I think that especially towards the true ending, it fails a bit at that, notably some of the rooms in the later area are really painful to go through (damn clock tower!)

Additionally, but that's a given, the touch screen things you needed to do for the bosses were awful. I recommend playing with a mod that removes them if you can

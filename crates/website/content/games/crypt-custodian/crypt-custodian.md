More ambitious than Islets, by the same creator, but I didn't like it as much. I liked the simpler story and shorter dialogues in Islets and the general gameplay felt better to me in Islets.

Additionally, the version I played on Gamepass had performance issues that introduced slight shutter (possibly due to variable frametime) which didn't help

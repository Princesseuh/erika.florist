After all those months of hardwork, SinaRun is finally ready for release! Yes, finally! For the occasion, my friend FoxFiesta made a super cool trailer:

	allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
	allowfullscreen

As previously said, the game is available on Steam and Itch.io:

Thanks everyone, I hope you have fun with the game!

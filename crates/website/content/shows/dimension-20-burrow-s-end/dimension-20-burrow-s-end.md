Aabria is as always absolutely wonderful with the NPC, but I felt like the story was quite uneven in its tone and the players didn't always interact with situations in satisfying ways.

I also had some problems with the battles in this campaign, the reveals were amazing and every time the players were doing anything else than fighting it was amazing, but the combat itself was, I don't know, just not super interesting.

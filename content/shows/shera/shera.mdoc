I overall liked this, it made me feel good. Though I definitely think it's weaker compared to similar shows. It does a lot of things well, it has nice representation and diversity (though sometimes it does feel a bit "White savior come to the rescue"), it has some very fun characters (My favorites being Entrapta, Catra and Angela) and certain scenes are really powerful and emotional on their own

But, I think it also fall short on a lot of things, certain characters get far from enough character development to justify how much screen time they take, the most blatant examples to me being Bow, Frosta and Hordak. Bow in particular is a character I hated from the first episode to the last, he felt like a band aid to fix situations and never his own character, apart from the dads episodes

I felt like the bad guys were for the most part, very shallow characters. The motivations behind Hordak's actions weren't explained until Season 4 (but they at least made a bit of sense in the greater scheme of things). And even Prime's motivations were very shallow, they were explained in one dialogue somewhere with the gist of it being "I'm evil and I will destroy everything to bring them peace!"

The story was also a bit hard to follow at times, I felt like it lost its focus a bit in some episodes. I think it would have been a better story had the scope been smaller, more focused on the main characters. I was disappointed a bit that they set up this entire world with the different kingdom only to spend 90% of the show in two places

Despite all I say, I think it's cool and fun to watch and would probably recommend to everyone who's looking for a simple, good and fun time

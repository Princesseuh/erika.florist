Very disappointed, I remember liking this one a lot when I was young but replaying it it's just not very fun most of the time. I know a lot of people think it gets better when you get to the dark world, but to me it was the complete reverse.

Past the dark world, the game just become more and more obnoxious, the exploration is more obnoxious, enemies are more obnoxious, the dungeons are more obnoxious. Some of the items you unlock are fun, but most of them are kinda unused most of the time and I don't know, just didn't like it. It definitely did set the tone for a lot of the next Zelda though, that's for sure.

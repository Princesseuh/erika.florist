This book is a lot, well at least it was when it came out but it's still a fairly important book and really inventive read. I'm not exactly an insane reader so a lot of it probably went over my head but I think I got the gist of the book, summaries and explanations online were pretty useful

I wish the pushy parts would have worked a bit better on me, I felt at times the book was trying a bit too hard to be smart and in the end, it often felt a bit more pretentious than it probably should have been

Additionally, I know that it's supposed to represent different styles of literature and the author himself makes fun of it towards the end but the ~sexy~ parts were really cringe. Just because you make fun of something doesn't mean you get to make the same mistake

Overall I liked it, though I think it could have been a little bit simplier while still getting its message through. But it's an old book, so it's probably fair that it's a bit clunky

### Quick note regarding the format

I read the paperback edition and the end of the book isn't padded with empty pages, not even a single one so I often saw parts of the end by accident. I wish there would have been a single blank page to avoid this, also there was few printing errors, it kept starting stories and never ending them, so annoying..

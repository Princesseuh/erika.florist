SinaRun is a first-person 3D platform/racing game, developped using [Unity](https://unity3d.com/) and written in [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/)

It was first released on [Itch.io](https://princesseuh.itch.io/sinarun) and then on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/324470/SinaRun/) in October 2015 after spending less than a month in the [Greenlight process](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=302937944)

The game has sold around 20,000 copies in total, with players all around the world enjoying it

Levels were designed and built directly inside Unity, using tools such as [ProBuilder](https://unity.com/features/probuilder) and [ProGrid](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.progrids@3.0/manual/index.html). Custom models were made using [SketchUp](https://www.sketchup.com/) and [Blender](https://www.blender.org/)

Gameplay was inspired by [Quake's DeFRaG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeFRaG), Doom's mazejump and Source Engine's [Surf](https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Surfing). All of those have pretty steep learning curves, which lead me to the idea of making the game as simple as possible while still maintaining an unique identity

The result is unfortunately not always as intuitive for newcomers as I hoped, however, feedback has overall been majorly positive, especially among players who got over the initial "bump"

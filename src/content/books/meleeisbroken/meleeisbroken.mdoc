Let me begin with: Melee is sick and this book is important and you should read it if you're interested in Melee's history and culture

But, this is an independent book from an indie writer and it shows. There's many mistakes throughout the book, be it grammar, missing words and others. Some words and concepts are heavily overused, especially "discourse", a word that comes up so often I might have forgot what it means

I'm not sure I agree with the thesis presented too, at least not completely, the book's main subject is how the Melee community and culture is shaped by the physical hardware limitations which to me, is only partly true but anyway, it's a good book, you should read it

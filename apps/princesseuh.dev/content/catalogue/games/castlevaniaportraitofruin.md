I wasn't sure if I would like the duo dynamic but ended up being a big fan, though I exclusively played as the woman (which I'm glad was entirely possible!)

Some of the areas are AMAZING, especially the circus part, I found it really really interesting.

However, the game has a big problem toward the ending that made it so it took me a long time to finish it because I got really bored: Having to redo alternative versions of every areas to reach the true ending. I thought it was unnecessary for those areas to be that big despite them bringing essentially nothing to the table.

I overall thought that the entire path to the true ending was insanely weak compared to the rest of the game, which left such a bad taste in my mouth that frankly, If someone asked for quick thoughts on this game, I'd say it's an average game, despite the first half being so good, very unfortunate

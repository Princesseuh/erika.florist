There's not many Swedish shows available on Netflix Canada so it was really cool to be able to experience it in VO. I could read most of the sentences more or less, that was pretty cool

I liked the story too, perhaps the pace could have been a little bit faster at times but it was okay. I kinda wish we saw more of the Prince especially in the first episodes. I feel like August was a bit too much the main character at times in Season 1.

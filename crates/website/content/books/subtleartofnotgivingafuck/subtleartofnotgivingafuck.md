This book is really popular and kinda short, so despite it not really being my thing, when I saw it available at my local library, I figured why not.

It's.. okay. Not my favorite, and definitely fall into the genre of "Self-Help Guru tries to pretend he's not like the other gurus", but nonetheless, some parts are kinda neat and I figure the more casual, friendly tone might reach some people in ways.

Loved this! Really enjoyed the characters (and the acting) especially, Joe and Cameron. Honestly, it somehow inspired me to get (at least a little bit more) into low-level programming. Mutiny's games seemed fun.

So many great quotes too, I especially liked this one from Joe:

> At the time, I thought I was unhappy with the project, but in hindsight I realized I was just unhappy with myself. So I guess that’s what I’ve been working on."

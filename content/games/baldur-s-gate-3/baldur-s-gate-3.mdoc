I wish it was a `loved`, but unfortunately despite all the great things, the game falls short to me in certain areas compared to DOS2 and I ended up not liking it as much. I'm not a big fan of DnD mechanics, so the gameplay wasn't always super fun to me.

I think I can allow one more Larian game with a somewhat bad big city act 3 and then I'll become angry.

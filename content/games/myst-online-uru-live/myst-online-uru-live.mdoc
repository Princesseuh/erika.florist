It's fun with friends, but it's honestly *so* clunky. Even in good faith, the mechanics around sharing books with friends are just so buggy, especially in certain ages.

The game itself is mostly fine, though some of the choices made **because** of the online aspect (hands puzzles everywhere etc) make it honestly, well, not that good of a game? But the environments and the vibes are absolutely incredible and playing with friends makes it pretty fun all in all. Weird game!

While trying to install the KDE file picker on Arch Linux, you'll most likely encounter the following situation unless you're already using KDE softwares: You'll install `kdialog` expecting it to be enough to open the KDE file dialog, but instead, you'll see this:

That's the default Qt file picker. To get the KDE one, the minimum list of packages (in addition to `kdialog`) you need to install are those:

- `plasma-integration`
- `breeze` or `breeze-icons` (It can work without but: you won't have icons. Alternatively, you can use another Qt theme)

With those installed, we get the expected KDE picker. It works nicely outside of a few things, namely thumbnails (the one thing we are here for!) and previews

For those to work, you need to install the `kio-extras` package and a few other packages in order get full support for various formats. On most systems you probably already have a few of the packages needed for the common formats (notably `libpng`) but you can install the following packages for other formats:

- `kimageformats` (bunch of stuff, check the optional dependencies)
- `qt5-imageformats` (for TIFF, MNG, TGA and WBMP)
- `ffmpegthumbs` (for video thumbnails, you might need to toggle it on and off in Dolphin because it's a bit wonky on Arch)
- `kdegraphics-thumbnailers` (for PDF, Blender models, RAW files)

After installing those, make sure their previews are enabled in Dolphin's settings (the config file is in `~/.config/dolphinrc`) and with all of that, you should have a working KDE file picker!

For full compatibility, you need to start programs with `XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP` set to `KDE` (which might unfortunately cause side effects in certain cases) or for programs that supports it, `GTK_USE_PORTAL` set to `1` with `xdg-desktop-portal` and `xdg-desktop-portal-kde` installed should be enough. For Electron apps, make sure its version is higher than 14 as it needs [this PR](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/19159)

Make sure `xdg-desktop-portal-kde` is running otherwise it won't work

You might need to restart the `xdg-desktop-portal` service after running `xdg-desktop-portal-kde` using `systemctl restart --user xdg-desktop-portal`

Congrats, with all that you literally installed more than 100 packages for a file picker. But it works and it's pretty so who's the winner really? ðŸ¥²

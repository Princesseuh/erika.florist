This book is a lot, well at least it was when it came out but it's still a fairly important book and really inventive read. I'm not exactly an insane reader so a lot of it probably went over my head but I think I got the gist of the book. Though summaries and explanations online were pretty useful

I wish the pushy parts would have worked a bit better on me, I felt at times the book was trying a bit too hard to be smart and in the end, it often felt a bit more pretentious than it probably should have been

Overall I liked it, though I think it could have been a little bit simpler while still getting its message through.

### Quick note regarding the format

I read the paperback edition and the end of the book isn't padded with empty pages, not even a single one so I often saw parts of the end by accident. I wish there would have been a single blank page to avoid this, also there was few printing errors, it kept starting stories and never ending them, so annoying..

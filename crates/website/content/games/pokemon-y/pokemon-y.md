I can very much understand anyone finding the Pokemon formula appealing, but the games are so unappealing. Even this one, which I have seen be lauded as being the most respectful of your time, feels like it was designed in a lab to be as disrespectful as possible.

From the dialogue, the level design, the UI, everything is made so you spend more time than you wished doing about anything. Add to this the Pokémon formula not being that interesting in the first place and the game being insanely easy and you end up.. well mostly pressing A.

The game also suffers from mechanical and technical issues, the controls are not good and the game sometimes lag in battle.

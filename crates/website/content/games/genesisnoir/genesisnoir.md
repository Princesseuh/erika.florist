I kinda liked this game but not really. It was really stylish, however I deeply wish things could have been clearer, I often got stuck because it wasn't clear what I needed to do. Also, I played this at release and it was unfortunately really buggy, I often had to restart the game to be able to progress

It dragged on a lot towards the end (making you repeat things multiple times without any real added value) and got more and more pretentious to me. The overall message of the game through its story and its gameplay was.. unclear

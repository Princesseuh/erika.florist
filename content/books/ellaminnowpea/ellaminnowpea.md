The author does abuse a bit with words sometimes, and if you've read that kind of story before you might not be really impressed

But overall, I think it's neat. It's a simple approach to totalitarianism and freedom of speech that is pretty easy to see as absurd sometimes but I think it's definitely part of the charm

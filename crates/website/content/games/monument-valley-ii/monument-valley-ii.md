The new mechanics added by the child are neat, the narrative makes a bit more sense thanks to that as well. This one overall ends up feeling less like a drag than the first one... But it's still ultimately the same thing. The puzzles are not very interesting and I found it really hard to care about it at all. It's pretty, though.

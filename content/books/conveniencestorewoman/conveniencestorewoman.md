I really like this book, it's a great showcase of how non-verbose books can be yet still say a lot of things (it's also really short!)

I first read this a long time ago but then re-read it in April 2020 after suggesting it to my partner because the main character reminds me of them. I really appreciate Keiko, she's simple and not afraid to be what she wants to be: A simple convenience store worker. And that's fine, it really is.

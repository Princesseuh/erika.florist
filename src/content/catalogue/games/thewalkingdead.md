After playing [The Wolf Among Us](/catalogue/games/thewolfamongus/), it was only natural to play this with my partner too. I must admit that it didn't reach my partner as much as I thought it would but that's okay - overall they enjoyed it

### Notes

- We played the original version and the technical issues were unfortunately really noticeable
- The dates refer to when I first played it on PC, not my first playthough
- I played it on PSVita originally before playing it on PC

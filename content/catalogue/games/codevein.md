Being a big fan of Dark Souls, I attempted playing this when it came out but I wasn't hooked and so I gave up quickly

This time around however, while I still wasn't hooked at first, I gave it a legit try and ended up.. actually mostly enjoying it? The game definitely has its flaws, such as unnecessary sexualized designs especially for the female characters, most areas having non-inspiring level design (The cathedral level was annoying), inconsistent difficulty curve or the not really interesting narrative

Yet, its gameplay was actually fairly fun, the fighting was cool, bosses were mostly good apart from a few and being able to mix and match different classes (blood codes) was really interesting. I had fun 👍

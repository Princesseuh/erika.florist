I had been eyeing the game for a while on Steam but it was a bit too pricy for me at the time

I enjoyed it but to me it wasn't anything special, it probably won't leave any lasting impression on me. I liked that the game tried a new "mechanic" every level, it was cool to discover what would be next. The story was cute, having lived through a similar story back in my childhood I definitely could relate to it

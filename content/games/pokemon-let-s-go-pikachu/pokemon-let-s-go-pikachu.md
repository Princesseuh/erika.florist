Alright, it's *still* Pokémon, and this one especially is quite on the easier side similarly to ORAS. However, this time around it feels much more conscious that it is intended for perhaps a younger or less experienced audience and it ends up feeling better.

Unfortunately, the game is insanely slow and even worse than usual to play at normal speed, and it's still Pokémon. But, I had fun overall and I can only +1 massively the removal of the random battles.

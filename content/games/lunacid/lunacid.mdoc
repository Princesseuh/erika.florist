I think this game is well made, it works very well, it's relatively fun, BUT it has no aura, mood, or vibe of its own, which fairly tarnished my enjoyment of the game. I felt like I was playing a best-of of other games and at time, a straight up copy of King's Field / Shadow Tower. 

I could excuse Demi looking suspiciously close to Rurufon, but then I was in Tower of Latria with a Moonlight Greatsword, which is fine, but I was hoping for something else.

Played through Uru Live. Playing with friends made it much easier to tolerate the flaws of the game.

The way the ages are interconnected, the esoteric mechanics etc are absolutely incredible, but the game suffers from being half of a online game, unfortunately.

I would still recommend, despite my rating!

Cute metroidvania by Team Ladybug, who also worked on Touhou Luna Nights, another game I really enjoyed. This one felt a bit shortish and things were a bit too samey samey, all the weapons felt fun to discover at first but you quickly realize they're mostly all the same

Unfortunate but I still really had fun, I was hoping this game would answer my thirst for a full, big Metroidvania by Ladybug but in the end it was still a small bite

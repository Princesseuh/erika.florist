Very cool! Very fun mechanics, BUT the tutorial is not very good and so the first feeling is really bad, but it mostly fixes itself in the first mission.

The dialogues are very cringe and not always in a good way, you almost made me drop my croissant made me laugh, destroy capitalism haha the shareholders, I think I'm over that by now, don't know.

Music is amazing. At times it's hard to really understand wtf is happening on your screen, which is a part of the genre sure, but I think the game could do better both in regard to visibility, but also the pacing of the fights. There's little to no incentive to slow down fights (if anything, it's the reverse! Don't stop girly pop!), but being at max speed all the time is: unreadable and offer little to no benefits, you can easily get S+ on all the levels of the demo without it.

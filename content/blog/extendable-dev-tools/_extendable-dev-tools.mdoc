I'm generally of the perhaps controversial opinion that we as humans can learn from each others, and while relevant to.. well, humanity as a whole - I want to talk about how game development tools had a genius idea that didn't make quite make it into other fields.

Game development nowadays is mostly done in big engines like Unity, Unreal Engine, Godot, etc. Not too dissimilar to perhaps web frameworks, but with one key difference that probably stemmed from engine makers wanting to lock users in and the cost (both in time and money) of switching engines for end-users. That key difference is: Those engines are, in fact, not engines, they're full-blown platforms.

Unity is the best example of this: you can write your own tools, [your own inspectors](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UIE-HowTo-CreateCustomInspector.html), [your own editors](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/editor-CustomEditors.html), your own everything really. And that's not just a random feature, it's a core part of the engine. Not just technically, but also in the ecosystem, [people are selling those custom inspectors](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/odin-inspector-and-serializer-89041), custom level editors or even [full-blown game making tools that are in fact, just plugins for Unity](https://rpgmakerunite.com/en/).

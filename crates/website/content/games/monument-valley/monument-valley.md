Probably hits hard if you haven't played Echochrome before.

More seriously, it's slow and not particularly interesting. Even outside of the main gimmick, the story is obtuse and.. not interesting, moving is slow, the animations in the menus are slow. Everything is slow. Perhaps it's to be contemplative and stuff, but I don't know, in all regards I feel like it has been done better.

Maybe if you haven't played Echochrome and you played it when it came out, maybe it was something.

I never really liked Hollow Knight all that much, but wanted to give this one a try hoping that the faster more dynamic combat stuff would pull me in, and in some ways it did....

However, well the game is just insanely frustrating in all aspects. You die too quickly, your own damage is just a bit too low when using all the tools the game provides, but you can't even always use them because some of them depend on some random currency you'd have to farm. Additionally, the runbacks to bosses are often very long and/or annoying.

Exploration is generally not worth it, most of the game's tools need to be bought from NPCs. Even bosses rarely drop anything.

I don't know, I don't understand what they were thinking.
